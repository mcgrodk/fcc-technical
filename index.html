        <p>This page will introduce some fundamentals of the Japanese language through basic phrases, grammar, and vocabulary. Each section listed in the sidebar will provide either a vocabulary list or a grammar explanation, which you can then apply to each of the <strong>Let's Try!</strong> exercises.</p>
    <ul>Upon completing this lesson, you should be able to:<ul>
      <li>Recite basic Japanese greetings and other useful phrases</li>
      <li>Make simple sentences about your name, age, and nationality</li>
      <li>Recall basic vocabulary including numbers, countries, occupations, and family members
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> The reader should be able to read <em>Hiragana</em> and <em>Katakana</em> to follow this lesson, as <em>Romaji</em> will not be used with Japanese sentences. <em>Kanji</em> characters will not be used in this lesson.
    <p>See <a href="http://guidetojapanese.org/learn/category/grammar-guide/the-writing-system/">Tae Kim's Guide to Japanese</a> for a lesson on the <em>Hiragana</em> and <em>Katakana</em> writing systems.

      <header>Japanese Greetings and Useful Phrases</header>
      <p>Before we dive into Japanese grammar, let's learn some basic greetings and everyday phrases. You may have heard some of these before in Japanese media and pop culture. If so, you’re coming into Japanese with a head start! Look over these phrases and try saying them a few times before going to the first grammar lessons.</p>
      <code>おはようございます。= Good morning. 	おはよう。= Good morning. (casual)
こんにちは。= Good afternoon. / Hello. (note that the 「は」is pronounced like 「わ」)
こんばんは。= Good evening. (that 「は」pronunciation applies here, too.)
おやすみなさい。= Good night.	おやすみ。= Good night. (casual)
さようなら。= Goodbye. (Implies a longer goodbye)
じゃあね。= Bye. / See you later. (casual)	すみません。= Excuse me.
ごめんなさい。= I'm sorry.		ごめん。= Sorry. (casual)
ありがとうございます。= Thank you.
ありがとう。= Thanks. (casual)
はじめまして。= How do you do? / Nice to meet you. (Said as a greeting when meeting someone new)
よろしくおねがいします。 = Nice to meet you. (Said when introducing oneself following one's name; also used as a greeting/polite phrase in other situations)
おなまえは？= What's your name? (なまえ means “name”; the 「は」is pronounced like 「わ」)
        はい。/ いいえ。= Yes / No </code>
      </section>
 
 <section class="main-section" id="Grammar_I_Am">
   <header>Grammar: “I Am” - NounはNounです</header>
   <p>The grammar particle 「は」marks the subject of a sentence, such as “I,” “He,” “Tom,” or whatever else a speaker is talking about. The Japanese language contains several of these “particles” that show the role of a word in a sentence, and the subject marker 「は」is the most fundamental of these particles. In learning Hiragana, you probably learned that 「は」is pronounced like 「わ」when used as the subject marker. This irregular reading may seem jarring at first, but will be easy to pick up as we read Japanese sentences in context.</p>
   <p>The word 「です」is used to complete a sentence following a noun. 「です」is like a period at the end of a sentence that makes something 'what it is.' It's the difference between just saying the word “doctor” and stating “I am a doctor.” By putting some nouns in their proper places with 「は」and 「です」, we can make some simple sentences that say “____ is _____.”</p>
   <code>わたしはトムです。
I am Tom.
かのじょはせんせいです。
She is a teacher.
   </code>
   <div class="note">
     <h2>Note: Null-Subject Language</h2>
     <p>Japanese is what is called a “null-subject language,” which means that the subject of a sentence can be omitted in cases when it is obvious to the speaker and listener. For example, if a person named Yuki introduces himself, 「ゆうきです」rather than 「わたしはゆうきです」is still a correct way to say “I am Yuki” because it is clear that Yuki is speaking of himself and giving his name.</p>

<section class="main-section" id="Vocabulary_Japanese_Occupations">
  <header>Vocabulary: Japanese Occupations</header>
  <p>Below is a list of some occupations in Japanese. Read over the vocabulary on this list and refer to it when doing the “Let’s Try!” exercises that follow.</p>
  <code>
    せんせい = teacher		がくせい = student		いしゃ = doctor
    かんごし = nurse		せんしゅ = athlete		ミュージシャン = musician
    かいしゃいん = office worker べんごし  = lawyer	かがくしゃ = scientist
  </code>

  <header>Let's Try! #1</header>
  <ul>Translate these Japanese sentences into English:</ul>
    <li>ジョンはいしゃです。</li>
    <li>かれはかいしゃいんです。</li>
    <li>かのじょはがくせいです。</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>Translate these English sentences into Japanese:</ul>
    <li>Tom is a lawyer.</li>
    <li>She is a scientist.</li>

<section class="main-section" id="Grammar_Are_You_Is_She">
  <header>Grammar: Are You? Is She? - The 「か」Question Marker</header>
  <p>Let’s add another grammar particle to what we know. The 「か」particle marks a question, so changing our sentence ender 「です」to 「ですか」takes us from “It is ___” to “Is it ___?” Forming questions is very easy in Japanese, because we can take the structure of an ordinary statement and add 「か」to the end to make it a question.
  </p>
  <code>がくせいですか。

  Are you a student?
  
  アメリカじんですか。
  
  Are you (an) American?
  </code>
</section>

<section class="main-section" id="Vocabulary_Countries_and_Nationalities">
  <header>Vocabulary: Countries and Nationalities</header>
  <p>Below is a list of country names in Japanese. Note that Japan and the East Asian countries are written in <em>Hiragana</em> (they have kanji characters as well), while the western nations are written in <em>Katakana</em>.</p>
  <code>にほん = Japan	ちゅうごく = China		かんこく = Korea		アメリカ = America/ the U.S.	カナダ = Canada		メキシコ = Mexico     スペイン = Spainフランス = France	イタリア = Italy		ポルトガル = Portugal	ブラジル = Brazil		イギリス = Britain / the UK		オーストラリア = Australia  ドイツ = Germany	コロンビア = Colombia</code>
  <p>To turn a country name into a nationality, simply add 「じん」(meaning “person”) to the end of it. 「にほんじん」means “Japanese” (a Japanese person), メキシコじん means “Mexican” (Mexican person), and so on. Try this out with a few more nationalities and refer back to this country list as we use these words in the grammar lessons that follow.
