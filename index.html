            <p>This lesson will introduce some foundational concepts of Japanese grammar. First we will learn about the building blocks of Japanese grammar that form sentences, and then we will learn how to form some basic sentences.</p>
        <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> The reader should be able to read <em>Hiragana</em> and <em>Katakana</em> to follow this lesson, as <em>Romaji</em> will not be used with Japanese sentences. <em>Kanji</em> characters will not be used in this lesson.
        <p>See <a href="http://guidetojapanese.org/learn/category/grammar-guide/the-writing-system/">Tae Kim's Guide to Japanese</a> for a lesson on the <em>Hiragana</em> and <em>Katakana</em> writing systems.

            <p>The Japanese language uses a system of grammar "particles" that indicate the role of different items in a sentence, such as subject, object, location, and date/time. These particles will be explained with further context in later sections of this lesson, but you can refer to the paragraphs below for a simple explanation of each particle and the role it fills in a sentence.</p>
          <h2>Subject Marker 「は」</h2>
          <p>The particle 「は」marks the subject of a sentence, so it is usually the first particle to be used in a complete Japanese sentence. Despite being written as 「は」, the character is pronounced like 「わ」whenever it is used as this subject marker particle.</p>
          <code>わたし<strong>は</strong>がくせいです。<br>
            I am a student. <br>
            かのじょ<strong>は</strong>にほんじんです。<br>
            She is Japanese.

            <h3>A note on "null-subject" sentences</h3>
            <p>Japanese is a "null-subject language," which means there are cases when the subject of a sentence can be omitted while still being gramatically correct.
